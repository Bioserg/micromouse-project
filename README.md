# MICROMOUSE PROJECT README

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the different modules that make up the micromouse: **The motherboard**, **the processor**, **the power subsystem** and **the sensing subsystem**.

### The motherboard
It's the base board that all the other modules will slot onto.

### The processor
A STM32L476 microcontroller that has 78 output pins for the power and sensing subsystem to use.

### The power subsystem
This module runs the motors and charges a battery.
The subsystem's design files are in the branch linked: [Power-Subsystem Branch](https://github.com/Bioserg/micromouse-project/tree/Power-Subsystem)

### The sensing subsystem
This module detects objects, in this case the walls of the maze.
The subsystem's design files are in the branch linked: [Sensing-Subsystem Branch](https://github.com/Bioserg/micromouse-project/tree/Sensing-Subsystem)
